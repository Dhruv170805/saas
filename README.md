Nexus POS is a **high-fidelity, distributed SaaS ecosystem** engineered for the modern restaurant floor. Gone are the days of polling-based legacy ERPs; Nexus leverages a **Reactive Event-Driven Architecture (REDA)** to deliver financial data and kitchen state with sub-100ms latency across global mobile fleets.

## 💎 The Nexus Vision
> *"Building for the grind requires more than code; it requires Mechanical Sympathy — an intimate understanding of the hardware, the network, and the human urgency of a peak-hour kitchen."*

## 🏛️ Zero-Trust Multi-Tenant Architecture

Nexus utilizes a proprietary **Context-Aware Gateway** that enforces strict isolation at every layer of the stack.

        Atlas[("L2 Persistence: MongoDB Atlas cluster")]
    end

## 🚀 Elite Feature Matrix

### 1. Military-Grade Tenant Isolation
Data contamination is impossible by design. Every database query is dynamically injected with a crytopgraphically verified `tenantId`, ensuring absolute privacy for restaurant chains sharing the infrastructure.
- **Verification**: Verified via `scripts/military_isolation_test.mjs`.

### 2. Mechanical Sympathy: GPU-Accelerated Mobile UI
The Flutter mobile fleet achieves a consistent **60 FPS** on sub-$100 ARM chipsets using **Repaint Boundary Isolation**. By decoupling volatile UI clusters from the global widget tree, we minimize rasterization cycles and thermal throttling.

### 3. Reactive Event Bus (REDA)
Orders don't "sync"; they **propagate**. Using a unidirectional event bus, table state changes (Occupied → Paid → Cleaned) are broadcasted instantly to all stakeholders, eliminating "Ghost Tables" and synchronization lag.

### 4. Autonomous CRM & Loyalty
The system doesn't just bill; it **learns**. A background worker asynchronously builds customer profiles from transaction data, utilizing pattern recognition to predict guest preferences and lifetime value (LTV).

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Protocol

### Control Plane (Self-Hosted / Cloud)
1. **Environment**: Enforce `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, and `APP_DOMAIN`.
2. **Bootstrap**: `npm install && npm run dev`.
3. **Migration**: `node scripts/migrate-to-multitenant.mjs` (Atomic Migration).

### Mobility Fleet (Native)
1. **Config**: Map `API_BASE_URL` and `X_TENANT_ID`.
2. **Deploy**: `flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi`.
