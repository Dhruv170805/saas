# 🛡️ Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Runbook: The Nexus Standard

## Operational Excellence & High-Availability Protocol

This document defines the rigorous operational standards and disaster recovery (DR) protocols for the Nexus POS SaaS ecosystem. Our mandate is to preserve **Financial Fidelity** and **Operational Continuity** across all tenants with a target availability of **99.95%**.

---

## 📊 1. Service Level Management (SLOs)

We measure success through three primary Service Level Indicators:

| Indicator | Objective (SLO) | Measurement Point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Availability** | 99.95% | Uptime of `/api/health` over 30 days. |
| **API Latency** | < 150ms (p95) | Measured at the Cloud Gateway edge. |
| **Synchronization** | < 50ms (p90) | WebSocket propagation delta (Server → Client). |
| **Data Durability** | 99.999% | PostgreSQL Point-in-Time Recovery success. |

## 🏛️ 2. Infrastructure Architecture (Defense-in-Depth)

The Nexus infrastructure is built on a **Zero Trust** foundation:
- **Tenant Context**: Every request is cryptographically bound to a tenant ID via JWT claims.
- **State Segregation**: Redis L1 cache uses tenant-prefixed keys to prevent cross-talk.
- **Persistence Isolation**: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensure logical separation of financial records.

---

## 🚨 3. Incident Management Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Detection & Triage
- **Automated**: Prometheus alerts fire when P95 latency exceeds 500ms for > 2 mins.
- **Manual**: Staff reporting via `PROD_URL/api/health` status page.

### Phase 2: Mitigation
1.  **Redis Failover**: If L1 cache is unreachable, system bypasses to L2 (Atlas).
2.  **Traffic Shifting**: Redirect API traffic if a specific regional cluster is degraded.

### Phase 3: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
All Critical (P0) incidents require a blameless post-mortem document within 48 hours of resolution.

## 🆘 4. Global Incident Matrix

| Symptom | Severity | Potential Cause | Immediate Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tenant Cross-Talk** | P0 (Critical) | Middleware Logic Error | 1. Maintenance Mode ON. 2. Revert last Deploy. |
| **Write Latency Spike** | P1 (High) | Atlas Cluster Throttling | 1. Scale Atlas Tier. 2. Enable Query Profiling. |
| **Socket Drop-off** | P2 (Medium) | LB Connection Timeout | 1. Verify Keep-Alive headers. 2. Cycle Gateway pods. |

---

## 🔒 5. Zero Trust Security Model

Nexus adheres to **Principle of Least Privilege**:
- **JWT Binding**: Access tokens are scoped to a single `tenantId` and `role`.
- **Audit Trails**: Every write operation is logged with a fingerprint (IP, User Agent, Timestamp) via `lib/audit.ts`.
- **Isolation Verification**: Weekly execution of `scripts/military_isolation_test.mjs`.

---

## 💾 6. High-Availability & Disaster Recovery (DR)

### 6.1 RTO & RPO Targets
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 30 minutes (Full system restore).
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 1 minute (Data loss limit).

### 6.2 The "Game Day" Protocol
Quarterly chaos engineering exercises where we simulate:
1.  Database partition failure.
2.  Tenant-specific "Traffic Bomb" (DDoS).
3.  Redis cache poisoning.

## 📜 7. Environmental Integrity Checklist

| Variable | Priority | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Critical | Primary Persistence (PostgreSQL). |
| `REDIS_URL` | High | Edge Caching & Session Pinning. |
| `APP_DOMAIN` | High | Root Domain for Subdomain Discovery. |
| `METRICS_TOKEN` | Medium | Authentication for Prometheus Scraper. |
